This project is a music project called Music Lounge. It was created by Alan Szmyt as a final project for the Computer Graphics Project Sequence at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
It is a music lounge environment created with Blender and exported using the Three.js library. It provides user interaction to play music created by Alan and plays visualizers that are linked
to the songs frequency data, therefore allowing the visualizers to match the songs' beats.
